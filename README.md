## What is this

This is a tool based on
[Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com)
to create stop motion animations and slides.

## How to use it

If you are already familiar with Excalidraw,
just visit <https://dai-shi.github.io/excalidraw-claymate>
and you can do the same.

The main difference is in the footer, where you can:

- add/edit scenes
- reorder scenes
- export the scenes as either:
  - an animated GIF
  - an HTML slide show (w/ animation, configurable order & speed).

Notes:

- The scene size is limited to the size of the first scene.
- Scenes are automatically saved to local storage
